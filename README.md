# 🏛️ Digital Civic Engagement Platform

##  Introduction

The **Digital Civic Engagement Platform** is a MERN Stack web application designed to bridge the gap between citizens and government officials. It empowers users to voice their concerns through digital petitions, participate in polls, and track the status of community issues in real-time.

This project aims to promote transparency and active citizenship by providing a secure, role-based environment where:
* **Citizens** can create petitions, sign existing ones, and view community reports.
* **Officials** can view issues specific to their jurisdiction (upcoming feature) and analyze community feedback.

---

##  Features
* **User Authentication:** Secure Login and Registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
* **Role-Based Access:** Distinct features for Citizens and Officials.
* **Petition Management:** Create, Read, and Sign petitions.
* **Smart Filtering:** Filter petitions by Category (Health, Infrastructure, etc.), Status, or Location.
* **Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard showing user stats and activity.
* **Duplicate Prevention:** Ensures a user cannot sign the same petition twice.
* **Responsive UI:** Built with React and Lucide Icons for a clean interface.

---

##  Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, React Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS (optional/if used).
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database).
* **Visualization & Maps:** Recharts (for Polls/Stats), Leaflet (for Location Maps).
* **Authentication:** BCrypt (Password Hashing), JWT.
